# PSP 0006 ‚Äî Shit Classes & OOP

## Abstract

This proposal defines the ‚Äúbest‚Äù practices for making object-oriented Python code **completely unreadable and psychologically taxing**.
Forget encapsulation, inheritance logic, and design patterns ‚Äî PSP-0006 embraces **chaos in every attribute**.

---

## Principles

1. **Class names must scream**
   Every class must be ALL CAPS, optionally with emojis or Cyrillic letters.

   ```python
   class WHY_DO_I_EXISTüò≠:
       pass
   ```

2. **Random inheritance**
   Inherit from unrelated built-in types for maximum confusion.

   ```python
   class CHAOS(dict, list, object):
       pass
   ```

3. **Method madness**
   Methods should randomly use `@staticmethod`, `@classmethod`, or none at all. Names must be nonsensical.

   ```python
   class WHATEVER:
       @staticmethod
       def IDK():
           return "???"
   ```

4. **Constructor overload**
   `__init__` must do random stuff that has nothing to do with initializing.

   ```python
   class EXISTENCE:
       def __init__(self):
           import random
           print(random.random() * 42)
   ```

5. **Attribute chaos**
   Attributes should randomly appear, disappear, or change type mid-execution.

   ```python
   class CHAOS:
       def __init__(self):
           self.x = 42
           self.x = "why"
   ```

6. **Useless inheritance chains**
   Make inheritance chains at least 5 levels deep with no purpose.

   ```python
   class A: pass
   class B(A): pass
   class C(B): pass
   class D(C): pass
   class E(D): pass
   ```

---

## Example

```python
class EXISTENTIAL_CRISIS(list, dict):
    def __init__(self):
        self.why = 42
        self.why = "pain"
    
    @staticmethod
    def WHAT_IS_LIFE():
        return "just chaos"
    
    def WHAT_AM_I_DOING(self):
        for i in range(9999):
            break
        return "idk"
```

## Conclusion

Shit OOP ensures:

* nobody can predict your objects‚Äô behavior,
* debugging is a full-time horror experience,
* python itself questions its existence. üêçüî•
