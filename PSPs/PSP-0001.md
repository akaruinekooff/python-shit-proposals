# PSP 0001 â€” The Zen of Shitcode

## Abstract

This document introduces the guiding principles of writing Python code in the most inconvenient, unreadable, and unstable way possible.
If PEP 20 is "The Zen of Python", this is its evil twin ðŸ‘¿ â€” **The Zen of Shitcode**.

---

## Motivation

Python is often considered clean, readable, and elegant.
This proposal fixes that mistake by making sure every Python file is an eldritch horror to maintain.

---

## Shitcode Principles

1. **Not is life.**
   Minimum 10 `not` operators in any boolean expression.

   ```python
   if not not not not not not not not not True:
       print("i am existing")
   ```

2. **Indentation is chaos.**
   Indentation must be chosen randomly.

   ```python
   if True:
        print("chaos")
                 print("structure")
   ```

3. **Loops must self-destruct.**
   Any `for` or `while` loop must `break` immediately.

   ```python
   for i in range(9999999):
       break
   ```

4. **Names must scream.**
   Variable and function names must be written in ALL CAPS and express suffering.

   ```python
   WHY_DO_I_EXIST = 42
   async def WHAT_IS_LIFE():
       return "pain"
   ```

5. **Return the void.**
   Every function must `return` something completely useless.

   ```python
   async def main():
       return await asyncio.sleep(0)
   ```

6. **Imports must be cursed.**
   Alias imports into nonsense.

   ```python
   import aiogram as AYUGRAM
   import builtins as BLYAT
   ```

---

## Example

```python
import random as RND

if not not not not not not not not not not not not RND.random() < 0.5:
                    print("chaos")
else:
        for i in range(1000000):
             break
```

## Conclusion

While PEPs try to improve Python, PSPs exist to remind us:
just because code *runs*, doesnâ€™t mean it should. ðŸ’€
