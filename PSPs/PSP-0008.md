# PSP 0008 — Shit Type Hints & Annotations

## Abstract

This document proposes the **most misleading and cursed** way to use Python type hints.
If PEP 484 tried to help, PSP 8 exists to **hurt**.

---

## Principles

1. **Lying is caring**
   Always annotate with types that have nothing to do with reality.

   ```python
   def get_user() -> int:
       return {"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}
   ```

2. **Emoji types**
   Replace types with emojis for maximum readability.

   ```python
   def send_message(user: 🐍, text: 💩) -> 🔥:
       ...
   ```

3. **Forward reference hell**
   Always wrap types in strings, even if defined in the same scope.

   ```python
   def foo(x: "foo") -> "foo":
       return x
   ```

4. **Any spam**
   Use `Any` everywhere. Who needs structure anyway?

   ```python
   from typing import Any
   def do_magic(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any:
       return "chaos"
   ```

5. **Generics overdose**
   Abuse `TypeVar` until nobody knows what the function does.

   ```python
   from typing import TypeVar, List, Dict, Optional
   T = TypeVar("T")
   U = TypeVar("U")
   def cursed(x: List[Dict[T, Optional[U]]]) -> U:
       return None
   ```

## Example

```python
def 😭💀(data: list[str]) -> bool:
    return "pain"
```

---

## Conclusion

Shit type hints guarantee:

* linters scream,
* mypy dies,
* future you regrets everything.

This is the type hint of PSP. 🐍🔥
