# PSP 0002 ‚Äî Shit Naming Convention

## Abstract

This document defines the *worst possible* naming convention for Python variables, functions, classes, and modules.
If PEP 8 is about clarity, PSP 2 is about **confusion maximization**.

---

## Naming Principles

1. **SCREAMING is mandatory.**
   All identifiers must be in ALL CAPS to simulate emotional breakdowns.

   ```python
   WHY_AM_I_ALIVE = 42
   ```

2. **MixedChaosCase**
   At least one name per file must randomly switch between `snake_case`, `camelCase`, `SCREAMING_SNAKE`, and `__weird__`.

   ```python
   def WhAt_Is_LiFe_bRo():
       pass
   ```

3. **One-letter roulette**
   Functions must occasionally be named `l`, `O`, `I` to make debugging hell.

   ```python
   def l(O, I):
       return O+I
   ```

4. **Unholy Abbreviations**
   Variables must be shortened until their meaning is lost.

   ```python
   MSGTXTINPVAR = "no idea what this is"
   ```

5. **Self-contradictory names**
   Functions must lie about their purpose.

   ```python
   def DELETE_ALL_FILES_BUT_ACTUALLY_JUST_PRINT_HELLO():
       print("hello")
   ```

6. **Unicode spice** üå∂Ô∏è
   Whenever possible, throw in Cyrillic letters, emojis, or mathematical symbols.

   ```python
   def üò≠–ü–ò–¢–û–ùüíÄ():
       return "pain"
   ```

---

## Example

```python
def WhY_DoEs_ThIs_EXiSt(MSGTXTINPVAR, üò≠):
    if MSGTXTINPVAR == "hello":
        return "bye"
    else:
        return "üíÄ" * len(MSGTXTINPVAR)
```

---

## Conclusion

Shit naming convention guarantees:

* nobody knows what the code does,
* linters cry,
* and your teammates quit.

This is the way of PSP. üêçüî•
