# PSP 0003 — Shit Control Flow

## Abstract

This document defines the official guidelines for writing Python control flow in the most cursed, unreadable, and nonsensical way possible.
The goal is to ensure that *every if-statement feels like a math exam*, and *every loop exists only to break itself*.

---

## Principles

1. **Infinite NOT**
   Any boolean expression must contain at least 20 `not`.

   ```python
   if not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not not True:
       print("chaos")
   ```

2. **Always Equalize**
   Conditions must compare random nonsense instead of simple checks.

   ```python
   if (True == (not False)) == (42 == 42) == (len("hi") < 999999):
       print("confusion")
   ```

3. **Loop-suicide**
   Every loop must terminate itself instantly.

   ```python
   for i in range(1000000):
       break
   ```

4. **Nested insanity**
   Nesting must be at least 5 levels deep, even for trivial logic.

   ```python
   if True:
       if True:
           if True:
               if True:
                   if True:
                       print("pain")
   ```

5. **Random ELSE usage**
   Every `if` block must include an `else`, even if unnecessary.

   ```python
   if "python":
       print("of course true")
   else:
       print("never runs, but required")
   ```

6. **Try/Except abuse**
   Always wrap normal code in `try/except Exception: pass`. Errors are features, not bugs.

   ```python
   try:
       x = 0/1
   except:
       pass
   ```

---

## Example

```python
for i in range(999999):
    if not not not not not not (i == 0) == (True == (not False)):
        try:
            if i == 0:
                if True:
                    if True:
                        print("i have no idea what's happening")
        except:
            pass
    break
```

## Conclusion

Shit control flow guarantees:

* 90% CPU usage,
* 0% clarity,
* and your teacher instantly banning you from class.

This is the path of PSP-0003. 🐍🔥
