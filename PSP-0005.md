# PSP 0005 ‚Äî Shit Exceptions

## Abstract

This document defines the most cursed practices for exception handling in Python.
While PEPs want you to handle errors gracefully, PSP-0005 ensures **errors ARE the program**.

---

## Principles

1. **Catch ‚Äòem all** üé£
   Always use a naked `except:`. Specific exceptions are for weak.

   ```python
   try:
       1/0
   except:
       pass
   ```

2. **Silence the screams** ü§ê
   Never log, never print. Just pretend nothing happened. Bugs love darkness.

   ```python
   try:
       open("file_that_does_not_exist.txt")
   except:
       pass
   ```

3. **Over-nest exceptions** ü™Ü
   Wrap every single line in its own `try/except`.

   ```python
   try:
       try:
           try:
               x = 1/0
           except:
               pass
       except:
           pass
   except:
       pass
   ```

4. **Abuse finally**
   Put completely unrelated code inside `finally`.

   ```python
   try:
       x = 1/0
   except:
       pass
   finally:
       print("i dont know why, but if it works dont touch it")
   ```

5. **Exception-driven programming** üö¶
   Replace normal control flow with exceptions.

   ```python
   try:
       raise ValueError("SJJFKSFKLSFHJFSJJHKFS")
   except ValueError:
       print("iADJLKSHJSJKHLFJKLSFHJKSFJHFHJSFJHKSLKdk")
   ```

6. **Raise nonsense**
   Raise strings, numbers, or objects, just because you can.

   ```python
   raise "error, but its string"
   ```

## Example

```python
def chaos():
    try:
        return 1/0
    except:
        try:
            raise "meme"
        except:
            try:
                return "bye"
            except:
                pass
    finally:
        print("chaos is winner")
```

## Conclusion

Shit exceptions guarantee:

* bugs turn into features,
* debugging becomes pointless,
* python cries with you üò≠üêç
