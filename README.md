# PSP — Python Shit Proposals 🐍💀

**Welcome to PSP — the ultimate collection of Python chaos rules.**
If PEPs make Python readable, PSP makes it… well, unmaintainable, confusing, and hilarious.

## What is PSP?

**PSP** stands for **Python Shit Proposal**.
It’s a satirical “official standard” for writing the worst, most chaotic Python code possible.

Think of it as:

* PEPs = clean, zen, logical Python
* PSPs = *everything that makes you question life while coding*

## Current PSPs

Here’s what we’ve “documented” so far:

| PSP # | Title                                  |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
| 0001  | The Zen of Shitcode                    |
| 0002  | Shit Naming Convention                 |
| 0003  | Shit Control Flow                      |
| 0004  | Shit Imports                           |
| 0005  | Shit Exceptions                        |
| 0006  | Shit Classes & OOP                     |
| 0007  | Shit Modules & Packaging               |

## Core Principles

* **Not is life:** every boolean must have at least 10 `not`.
* **Chaos indentation:** random spaces = maximum confusion.
* **Loops must self-destruct:** `for` and `while` loops break immediately.
* **Screaming names:** variables, functions, classes — ALL CAPS & exclamation points welcome.
* **Exception-driven programming:** errors are features, not bugs.
* **Import madness:** alias everything to nonsense, use circular imports, put code in `__init__.py`.
* **Useless OOP:** classes that do nothing useful, attributes that change type mid-execution.
* **Module nightmare:** deep nesting, emojis, non-ASCII filenames, random side effects.
