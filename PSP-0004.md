# PSP 0004 ‚Äî Shit Imports

## Abstract

This proposal defines the most cursed practices for importing modules in Python.
If PEP 8 wants clarity, PSP 4 ensures that **nobody knows what the hell got imported**.

---

## Principles

1. **Nonsense Aliases**
   Every module must be renamed into total –∞–±—Ä–∞–∫–∞–¥–∞–±—Ä–∞.

   ```python
   import aiogram as AYUGRAM
   import builtins as BLYAT
   import os as –û–°–¨–ú–ò–ù–û–ì
   ```

2. **Import Everything, Always**
   Never import specific names, always `import *` ‚Äî preferably multiple times.

   ```python
   from math import *
   from random import *
   from this import *
   ```

3. **Circular Confusion**
   Import your own file into itself.

   ```python
   import main as MAIN
   ```

4. **Fake Libraries**
   Alias standard libs as if they were frameworks.

   ```python
   import sys as DJANGO
   import time as FLASK
   ```

5. **Over-indent imports**
   Randomly put imports in the middle of functions, loops, or conditions.

   ```python
   def chaos():
           import random
           if True:
                       import asyncio
   ```

6. **Import with side effects**
   Make sure imports immediately do stupid stuff.

   ```python
   import antigravity 
   import this 
   import __hello__ 
   ```

---

## Example

```python
if True:
         import math as –ú–ê–¢–ê–ù
         from os import * 
         import sys as SYST–ï–ú–ê

         def üò≠():
                  from random import choice as –í–´–ë–û–†_–°–£–î–¨–ë–´
                  return –í–´–ë–û–†_–°–£–î–¨–ë–´(["–∏–¥–∏ –Ω–∞—Ñ–∏–≥", "—Ö–∞–æ—Å", "–ø–ª–∞—á—å"])
```

## Conclusion

Shit imports create:

* linters in coma,
* python is crying,
* and code looks like a shamanic ritual. ü™Ñüêç
